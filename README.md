# HR_Analytics

This project analyzes three months (April, May, and June) of real-world HR attendance data using Power BI.  

The dataset includes detailed worker attendance information, tracking statuses like present, week off, holiday, work from home, half-day work from home, sick leave, and half-day sick leave.  

The data was imported into Power BI and transformed using Power Query, including adding new columns and unpivoting existing ones.

DAX measures and calculated columns were then implemented to derive key metrics.  

Finally, the data was visualized to analyze trends such as present percentage, sick leave percentage, work from home percentage, and preferred days for work from home, providing valuable insights into employee attendance patterns.
